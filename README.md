# Temporal-Relations-of-Informative-Frames-in-Action-Recognition

In this paper,to detect actions we have 3 step; at the first step we use a frame selection algorithm to avoid from redunduncy of videos wich explained in this paper [Adaptive Frame Selection In Two Dimensional Convolutional Neural Network Action Recognition](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/368726751_Adaptive_Frame_Selection_In_Two_Dimensional_Convolutional_Neural_Network_Action_Recognition) and code can be found there([Code](https://github.com/Alirezarahnamaa/Adaptive-Frame-Selection-Algorithm)   at first we use a frame selection algorithm [Temporal Relations of Informative Frames in Action Recognition](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/379714148_PDF_Temporal_Relations_of_Informative_Frames_in_Action_Recognition)
